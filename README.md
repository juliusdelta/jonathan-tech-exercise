# ClickFunnels Technical Exercise - Funnels Team

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, {candidate_name}!

You'll be given 1 hour alone to complete this exercise.

The tool requirements for this exercise are that you must use:

- this Vite (React) application
- Redux (Toolkit) for state management
- React Router (v6) for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling (as much as possible)
  Outside of those constraints you're welcome to use any other npm packages that you might need. _Note: We've provided some package imports and prompts in certain test cases and files that you are free to use._

All of the code requirements can be found in `./App.test.tsx`, where we've outlined all of the required test cases you need to complete. Each test case should break down the different features you'll need to implement. There is also a separate "stretch goal tests" that are optional, so if you have any extra time and want to take a stab at those then you're more than welcome to. If you're stuck on any particular test case for too long, we encourage you to move on and try to complete as many test cases as you can. _Note on the test suite: Make sure you delete the `.fails` on each test cast (`it()`) before writing your tests as they are there to force empty tests to fail, so that you can see the tests you still need to complete in the test UI._

## Getting up and running

- You'll need to install node version v16.13.0
  - If you have nvm installed, you can run `nvm use` or `nvm install` to install this node version if it.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
  - This will boot up the application, the test UI, and storybook in separate tabs for you.
  - Using Storybook is completely optional, but it's there if it you want it.

Good luck! ðŸš€
