# ClickFunnels Technical Exercise - Funnels Team

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, Jonathan!

You'll be given 1 hour alone to complete this exercise.

The tool requirements for this exercise are that you must use:

- this Vite (React) application
- Redux (Toolkit) for state management
- React Router (v6) for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling (as much as possible)
  Outside of those constraints you're welcome to use any other npm packages that you might need. _Note: We've provided some package imports and prompts in certain test cases and files that you are free to use._

## Getting up and running

- You'll need to install node version v16.13.0
  - If you have nvm installed, you can run `nvm use` or `nvm install` to install this node version if it.
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
  - This will boot up the application, the test UI, and storybook in separate tabs for you.
  - Using Storybook is completely optional, but it's there if it you want it.

## Exercise Instructions

All of the code requirements can be found in `./src/App.test.tsx`, where we've outlined test cases that describe the work you need to complete. **You do not need to implement tests for this timed exercise!**

Also, there is a separate "stretch goal tests" section that describes some optional features, so if you have any extra time and want to take a stab at those then you're more than welcome to. If you're stuck on any particular feature for too long, we encourage you to move on and try to complete as many features as you can.

This application is intended to track state with Redux. A store has been added as a starting point at `./src/lib/store/store.ts`

Good luck! ðŸš€
